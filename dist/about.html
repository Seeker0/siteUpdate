      <p>I took the long way 'round in becoming a software developer, but have always been a student. Whether in or out of a classroom, and even in my downtime, you can usually find me investigating some scientific theory, academic study, animal, or other topic that peaks my interest. This has been reflected in both my work history and performance. I often find that looking at a problem from another perspective, even one outside the discipline of the current task, offers unique avenues and possible solutions. (And yes, I am that guy who spits out random facts mid-conversation because you said a word that jogged something in my memory.)</p>
